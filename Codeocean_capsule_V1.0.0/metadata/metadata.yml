description: Polyauxic Modeling Plataform is an open-source Python package designed
  for the robust kinetic modeling of mono- and polyauxic microbial growth. Addressing
  the limitations of standard single-phase analysis, this software implements semi-mechanistic
  reformulations of Boltzmann and Gompertz equations to extract biologically interpretable
  parameters from complex datasets. The computational workflow integrates a hybrid
  optimization pipeline, combining Differential Evolution for global search with L-BFGS-B
  for local refinement, alongside the ROUT method for outlier detection and information
  criteria (AIC, BIC) for automated phase selection. This modular framework ensures
  reproducibility and numerical stability, providing researchers in environmental
  biotechnology a powerful tool to analyze multiphasic substrate degradation dynamics.
